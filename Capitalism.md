The greatest lie perpetuated on the modern world is that capitalism is built on the premise that hard, honest work is what creates individual wealth.

The common reason people give for rejecting socialism or communism is that they don't think it is fair that lazy people should get handouts from the government, paid for by the taxes on the hard working and honest citizens. The premise of this, of course, is that capitalism has a monopoly on the concept of fair earnings through labor.

The reality is the exact opposite, though.

The fundamental premise of capitalism is that the driving force of an economy is capital, not labor. That is, in the capitalist economy, ownership and wealth generates wealth, not labor.

If this sounds ridiculous, it is because it is, but the fact is that in a capitalist economy, those with wealth are basically handed the earnings of those who labor simply because they own something. They don't work to generate this additional wealth. No, the ownership entitles them to a portion to the labors of others.

The obvious example of this is the factory owner who doesn't work in the factory, but extracts his wealth from the labor of the factory workers. His only contribution to factory is his ownership, yet this entitles him to the first and largest share of all the wealth the factory produces.

This is also obvious in the case of a landowner whose wealth entitles them to extract rents from those inhabiting the land. The inhabitants work the land, grow the crops, and with the aid of the sun and the earth and the plants are able to extract a product that gives life, which they sell, but it is ultimately the landowner who gets the biggest portion of any wealth generated.

In our modern world this has become even more abstract with complex systems of debit and credit. Those who own the wealth don't own factories or land or anything but the abstract concept of interest or shares in other people's enterprises. Apart from occasionally voting to install a new director, they don't do anything, but they are given the top cut of the profits from every company.

Some may argue that their contribution is risk, that these people have entrusted their wealth with others, and that this risk entitles them to these profits, but in the era of "Too Big to Fail" it is clear that the system of modern capitalism is engineered to have any risk for these people at the top of the capitalist order.
